Some inconsistencies on the "name" of a driver. In the User's Guide, it 
tells you to set station_type to what is really the stanza name ---
something like FineOffsetUSB. However, the utility wee_config requires
you to specify the actual driver location, weewx.drivers.fousb.

Similar problem with extension names.
