              TODO before the next release:

Allow any archive database to have its daily summary rebuilt.

Capture LOOP data for highs and lows

Optimize tags $current. Right now, they all require a database hit.

Return value of Archive.getSqlVectors() and getSqlVectorsExtended() has changed.

Support ConfigObj v5.0.0

Is max gap fraction meaningful for bar charts now?

Is Archive.getSql and Archive.genSql needed now?

Add documentation for the extension installer and extension packaging.
