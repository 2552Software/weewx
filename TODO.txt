TODO before the next release:

Capture LOOP data for highs and lows

Optimize tags $current. Right now, they all require a database hit.

Allow different database bindings (besides 'archive_database'). These
should bind a database and a management class.

Add documentation for the extension installer and extension packaging.

Return value of Archive.getSqlVectors() and getSqlVectorsExtended() has changed.

Support ConfigObj v5.0.0

Is max gap fraction meaningful for bar charts now?

Is Archive.getSql and Archive.genSql needed now?
