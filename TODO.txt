             ---- Before the V3.7 release ----

Add the ability to patch windSpeed to wee_database.

The accumulators need to be aware whether this is a V1 or V2 daily summary.

Remove invoking the weighting patch from engine.py

Document the existence of both the windSpeed and weighting patches in upgrading.htm

Test partial rebuild of daily summaries on both sqlite and MySQL

Decide whether backfill is still necessary. Is it sufficient to check on startup
whether the daily summaries exist and, if not, do a rebuild.

Update test suites to reflect the name change and movement of the old xsearch.py.
