             ---- Before the V3.7 release ----

Decide on strategy for updating daily summaries. Two options:
1. User patches at his leisure, using wee_database. Weewxd is aware of V1 and V2 summaries. Refuses 
to run on partial update.  
2. Weewxd refuses to run until database has been updated. User would do this using wee_database.

Either way, we can remove invoking the weighting patch from engine.py

Add support for fixing windSpeed to patch module 

Document the existence of both the windSpeed and weighting patches in upgrading.htm

Test partial rebuild of daily summaries on both sqlite and MySQL

Decide whether backfill is still necessary. Is it sufficient to check on startup
whether the daily summaries exist and, if not, do a rebuild.
