    # Parameters used when importing from a CSV file

    # If there is no mapped interval field how will the interval field be
    # determined for the imported records. Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            weewx using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   xx     - Use a fixed interval of xx minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #            This setting is recommended for WU imports.
    #
    # Note: If there is a mapped interval field then this setting will be
    #       ignored.

    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements.

    # Some sources include UV and radiation values irrespective of whether the
    # station is equipped with UV and solar radiation sensors. The weewx
    # convention is to store the None value if no sensor or observation is
    # present. Specify whether a UV and/or solar radiation sensor was present
    # when the data to be imported was created. Set True if sensor fitted,
    # False if not. Default is True.
    # For a CSV import these values should be set to False if the respective
    # observations do exist in the CSV import data but the respectived sensor
    # was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise they may be
    # set to True or omitted.

    # dateTime field is to be extracted. wee_import first attempts to interpret

    # What does the imported rain field represent, is it the total rainfall
    # since the last record or a cumulative daily value. Available options
    # are:
    #   discrete   - rain field represents total rainfall since last record
    #   cumulative - rain field represents a cumulative daily rainfall reset

    #   lower is the lower limit of acceptable wind direction in degrees
    #   (may be negative)
    #   upper is the upper limit of acceptable wind direction in degrees
    #
    # It is possible, particularly for a calculated direction, to have a value
    # (eg -45) outside of the weewx limits (0 to 360 inclusive). Imported
    # values from lower to upper will be normalised to the range 0 to 360.
    # Values outside of the parameter range will be stored as None. Default

    # Map CSV record fields to weewx archive fields. Format is:
    #
    #   weewx_archive_field_name = csv_field_name, weewx_unit_name
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name is an observation name in the weewx database
    #   schema.
    #   csv_field_name is the name of a field from the CSV file.
    #   weewx_unit_name is the name of the units, as defined in weewx, used by
    #   csv_field_name. This value represents the units used for this field in
    #   the CSV file, wee_import will do the necessary conversions to the unit
    #   system used by the weewx archive.
    #
    # For example,
    #   dewpoint = dew, degree_C
    # would map the CSV field dew, in degrees C, to the archive field dewpoint.
    #
    # Archive fields that do not exist in the CSV data may be omitted. Any
    # omitted fields that are derived (eg dewpoint) may be calculated during
    # import using the equivalent of the weewx StdWXCalculate service through
    # use of the --calc-missing command line parameter.

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.

    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            weewx using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.

    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    # Due to WU frequently missing uploaded records, use of 'derive' may give
    # incorrect or inconsistent interval values. Better results may be
    # achieved by using the 'conf' setting (if weewx has been doing the WU
    # uploading) or setting the interval to a fixed value (eg 5). The most
    # appropriate setting will depend on the completeness and (time) accuracy
    # of the WU data being imported.

    # WU has at times been known to store large values (eg -9999) for wind
    # direction, often no wind direction was uploaded to WU. The wind_direction
    # parameter sets a lower and upper bound for valid wind direction values.
