	# This section lists all the images to be generated, what SQL types are to
	# be included in them, along with many plotting options, such as color or
	# font. There's a default for almost everything, if not specified
	# below. Nevertheless, I've explicitly put in values, to make it easy to see
	# and understand the options.
	#
	# Fonts can be anything accepted by the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which
	# is currently truetype (.ttf), or PIL's own font format (.pil). See
	# http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagefont.htm for more
	# details.  Note that "font size" is only used with truetype (.ttf)
	# fonts. For others, font size is determined by the bit-mapped size, usually
	# encoded in the file name (e.g., courB010.pil). If a font can't be found,
	# then a default font will be used.
	#
	# Colors can be specified any of three ways:
	#   1. Notation 0xBBGGRR;
	#   2. Notation #RRGGBB; or
	#   3. Using an English name, such as 'yellow', or 'blue'.
	# So, 0xff0000, #0000ff, or 'blue' would all specify a pure blue color.
